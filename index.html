            <h3>What we do:</h3>
            <p>We will be modelling the behaviour of US senators and congressmen, which include their basic and background information (their roles in the Legislative Branch, political orientation/party, career sector et cetera), their publicly disclosed trading activities (stock bought/sold, timing), and their bill voting records (the bills voted on, stance on the bill). This database will be the backbone for our information query system, allowing the public to view the recent activity of politician(s) to facilitate monitoring, discovery of conflicts of interests, and prevent/limit corruption of public figures.</p>
